For instance, when I removed the punctuation mark from \"David's\" and replace it with a space, I got \"David\" and a single character \"s,\" which has no meaning. To remove such single characters, I used \\s+[a-zA-Z]\\s+ regular expression, which substituted all the single characters having spaces on either side with a single space.\n",

    "I again used the regular expression \\s+ to replace one or more spaces with a single space. The alphabet letter \"b\" is appended before every string when you have a dataset in bytes format. The regex ^b\\s+ removes \"b\" from the start of a string. The next step was to convert the data to lower case so that the same words but have different cases can be treated equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final preprocessing step was lemmatization. In lemmatization, I reduced the word into dictionary root form. For instance, \"cats\" was converted into \"cat.\" Lemmatization was done to avoid creating semantically similar but syntactically different features. For example, I did not want two features named \"cats\" and \"cat,\" which were semantically similar. Therefore, I performed lemmatization."

    "I used tf–idf, a numerical statistic intended to reflect how important a word was to a document in a collection or corpus. The TF stands for \"Term Frequency\" while IDF stands for \"Inverse Document Frequency.\" The tf–idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document. It is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. The term frequency is calculated as Term frequency = (Number of Occurrences of a word) / (Total words in the document). The tf–idf value for a word in a particular document is higher if the frequency of occurrence of that word is higher in that specific document but lower in all the other documents. \n",

I used the pipeline tool combined with RandomizedSearchCV to assemble several steps that can be cross-validated while setting different parameters. Because tf–idf makes use of the statistical properties of the training data, I used a pipeline to ensure the results of the grid search are valid. As such, the preprocessing step in the pipeline includes TfidfVectorizer. I used XGBoost for classification. RandomizedSearchCV ran through 100 randomly selected combinations of various parameters fed into the parameter grid and produced the best combination of parameters based on the precision scoring metric."
